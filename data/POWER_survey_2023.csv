Honestly, it is impossible for a women to have a healthy baby with less than 9 month maternity leave.

For a mother it is near-impossible to sustain because of the scheduling commitment when brestfeeding a baby. Babies breastfeed at least 5 times during the day until they are at least 1 year old. They continue to breastfeed past one year, but the schedule becomes more flexible. Some people (mostly men, or folks without children) believe there is a solution, which is pumping breasts every 3 hours and going to work with a fridge to carry pumped milk home, so that it can be frozen and defrosted to give to the baby as needed. However, this method is actually more time-consuming than direct breastfeeding, because it adds pumping time, and cleaning time, in addition to feeding time. It also ruins milk quality, as it looses nutrition, hormones, enzymes, and antibodies when stored, and babies rely on mothers hormones and protein factors to regulate their circadian rhythm, digestion, and growth. Mothers who pump do not get more work done, but they might look like they work more. Adequate leave and breastfeeding support for mums are essential."

However, even with these supports, childcare in the Cambridge/Boston area remains perilously unaffordable on a postdoc salary. Annual costs for childcare (e.g. 3k / month for an infant and 2 k / month for a preschooler = 60 k annually) can easily EXCEED a postdoc's ENTIRE net annual income, and are the highest in the country by a wide margin. Families with children also face increased housing costs (i.e. requiring a two bedroom apartment) in a difficult housing market. Even for families with a second moderate income and from privileged backgrounds, childcare costs here are causing great financial stress and insecurity, lost productivity at work, depletion of savings, utter inability to save for the future (e.g. retirement, home ownership, college), and even substantial debt accumulation. For those less fortunate, being a postdoc parent at MIT is completely unfeasible. Postdoc *Fellow* parent financial suffering is even more pronounced, as several benefits are lost as a consequence of their success: loss of the pre-tax Dependent Care FSA / owing tax on the portable childcare benefit, and increased family health insurance costs payed with post-tax dollars. In summary, the extreme costs incurred by MIT postdoc parents are not sustainable for attracting and retaining diverse and talented postdocs and are not conducive to postdocs thriving in their work at MIT. Beyond increasing childcare supplements for postdoc parents, it would also be great to see MIT publicly lobby in support of Massachusetts' Common Start Coalition (commonstartma dot org) and their efforts to make childcare accessible and affordable for Massachusetts Families."

I became a new dad in the 2nd year of my career as a research scientist. I really appreciated that I had a chance to take a paid parental leave for a month. Indeed, the policy on childcare / parental leave was a point seriously considered to decide whether I would keep staying at MIT or go elsewhere when the current job was offered. In fact, without such leave, we were not able to survive because my spouse took a full two months for the recovery from the delivery. Given that typical child care here can accept a baby only after 7-8 weeks from the birth, I sincerely hope that the paid leave will be extended to 2 months rather than just a month; that should be a critical part for MIT to meet the global (not only the US) standard for parental leave policies.",No,,No,I took 4 weeks.,100,Yes,No,5,4,"I would point out two things.

- For a young PI (or scientist) like me, travels for conferences, etc, are inevitable for career success. The current benefits only support if a scholar takes her/his child(ren) with travel, and does not consider if children stay at home with her/his spouse during travel. Because of this, we often have to pay extra for childcare pick up and baby shitting until my spouse comes back home. This has caused significant expenses, and this would likely happen to many scholars who often don't have families nearby. The travel child support should be extended for cases where the rest of the family takes care of their children during the travel. 

- Extension of a period for paid parental leave would be really critical as there is an international demand to secure a longer paid leave and we in the US are behind that trend. At least, the institution should give enough support for the typical period, say, several weeks, for parents to send their newborn babies to childcare. ",
