POWER Survey 2023 on Parental Leave and Childcare Policies at MIT
==============================

In Summer 2023, an anonymous [survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fMhWOel-4FEX4SDK02NLmEE5upsajKBK/view?usp=sharing) was sent out to postdocs on the topic of parental leave and childcare policies at MIT. 

104 postdocs responded and the [results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VMELasSNFhN1QjrGt7P7uAFt0IQIIH-c8I0jKGWZdzI/edit?usp=sharing) of this survey were shared with the director of postdoctoral services and the director of MIT Daycare in July 2023. 

The notebook used to analyse the results is available [here](https://github.com/maedbhk/POWER_survey/blob/main/notebooks/power_survey.ipynb). If you are looking for the raw data from the survey, please contact Maedbh King at maedbhking@gmail.com
